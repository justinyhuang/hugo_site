This is a new personal project of mine. I build this dummy book with my personal notes when learning AMBA.

<!--more-->

So initially it will be a list of reading notes / memos. The plan is to first prepare the building blocks, polish them, and then put them in places the way a book is produced.

Below is the currently up-to-date road map of understanding the AMBA:

1. Top Level View of AMBA
    - Generations and History
    - AMBA protocols
2. AMBA 3 Deep Dive
    - How does APB works
    - How does AHB works
    - How does AXI3 works
3. AMBA 4 Deep Dive
    - How is APB v2.0 different than APB v1.0
    - How does ACE works
    - How is AXI4 different than AXI3
    - What about AXI4-Lite and AXI4-Stream
4. AMBA 5 Deep Dive
    - How does CHI works
5. The Not So Dummy Resources

This post will be updated with future updates and new post of this *Dummies* series.
